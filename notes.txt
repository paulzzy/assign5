BASIC TESTING

- Create test directory and rudimentary script to validate that `randall`
outputs the correct number of bytes.

- Call test from Makefile

CODE SPLITTING

- I copy-pasted chunks of the code in randall.c into their appropriate files
(following the spec).

- Also, I put #include directives in the appropriate places.

- Besides #include, the only modifications I made were to remove `static` from
the functions that are used by other C files. Functions that were only used
within the same file were kept `static`.

ADDING OPTIONS

- Modify Makefile to enable AddressSanitizer and Undefined Behavior Sanitizer

- Use the `getopt` function (see docs at
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Using-Getopt.html) to
implement option parsing.

- I use a switch-case statement to modify the program's behavior based on the
user-supplied options.

- Implementing a wrapper around `mrand48_r` requires seeding in the
`mrand48_r_wrapper_init` function. Also, `mrand48_r` only returns 32-bit values,
so a bit of work was required to return 64-bit random values.

- To allow an arbitrary filename to be the random source, I had to add an extra
function `software_rand64_set_file` to set the filename since `initialize`
doesn't take arguments. Modifying `initialize` would change how every other `-i`
argument works, since I opted to just add an extra function.
