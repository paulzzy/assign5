BASIC TESTING

- Create test directory and rudimentary script to validate that `randall`
outputs the correct number of bytes.

- Call test from Makefile

CODE SPLITTING

- I copy-pasted chunks of the code in randall.c into their appropriate files
(following the spec).

- Also, I put #include directives in the appropriate places.

- Besides #include, the only modifications I made were to remove `static` from
the functions that are used by other C files. Functions that were only used
within the same file were kept `static`.

ADDING OPTIONS

- Modify Makefile to enable AddressSanitizer and Undefined Behavior Sanitizer
